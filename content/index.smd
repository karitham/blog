# Kar's thoughts

I'm Karitham, a passionate [open-source contributor](https://github.com/Karitham) and Go expert with a drive to build and explore.

This blog is my attempt to improve my writing skills and share my thoughts on various topics, mostly about technology.

By regularly posting here, I aim to organize my ideas better and challenge myself to learn something new.

This website is built using [zine](https://zine-ssg.io) and styled with the [catpuccin](https://catppuccin.com) palette.

Welcome to my blog â€” a place for real thoughts written by a real human.
